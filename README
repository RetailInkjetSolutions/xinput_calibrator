Build instructions:
-------------------
vim configure.ac                                                    # update version string at AC_INIT line
./autogen.sh --with-gui=x11                                         # prepares build environment and runs ./configure
make                                                                # makes binary

Build instructions for making a .deb:
-------------------------------------

Note that in order to get this project to build I had to make some modifications to src/Makefile.am.

make dist                                                           # builds source .tar.gz
cd ..                                                               # go to parent folder
tar -xvf [filename of generated tar.gz]                             # extract the .tar.gz you just built
cd [folder created by tar]                                          # change into extracted folder
vim debian/control                                                  # make any changes you need 
 << edit any files you need to edit, like debian/control (for version string) or debian/changelog >>
dh_make -f ../[relative path and filename of generated tar.gz]      # debian build step 1
dpkg-buildpackage -=B -ai386 -uc -us                                # debian build step 2

Usage:
------
Simply run:
    xinput_calibrator

For more information, run with --help or check the manpage.
The scripts/ directory constains scripts to get calibration from hal or use a pointercal file to reapply xinput commands across reboots
